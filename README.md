# pufferd templates

These are templates which are contributed by the community, which are not included in the default pufferd distribution.

To add a template, please make a pull request following the existing location structure of the other templates.

Make sure to include a `templatename.md` file to list any prerequisites, workarounds, or list things that aren't quite working right.

Please see [this documentation](https://pufferd.pufferpanel.com/docs/creating-pufferd-templates) for instructions on how to create your own template.

Additional templates may be found on the [community forum](https://community.pufferpanel.com/category/3/templates-and-modifications).
