Terarria Template

Doesn't work very well, see [this forum post](https://community.pufferpanel.com/topic/577/an-incredibly-buggy-terraria-template) for more information.

* The console output in the menu is often garbled, making using the menus really difficult.
* When the server prompts you for an option in the menu, it's not possible to hit Enter for the default value. This also means that you have to type in a value for when it asks you a password - you can't have a passwordless server.
* Console commands don't work in the menus, since Terraria won't accept text commands until the world is loaded. This also makes it practically impossible to stop the server while on a menu screen without using the **"My server isn't responding! Please `kill it`."** option.
