Zandronum Template

This is a proof of concept for a Zandronum DOOM server template.

It is extremely basic, and I've only tested it to make sure that it runs. The server by default downloads a 2.1.2 64 bit copy of Zandronum and downloads the DOOM 1 shareware IWAD.

If there are multiple wads in the directory, the server console will prompt you to choose one.
